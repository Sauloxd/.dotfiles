* TMUX
Configuring tmux is too hard, and I can't deal with another config.
Just use https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux and be happy
** Local Overrides
#+begin_src bash :tangle "tmux.conf.local"
#!/bin/bash
# This code is generated by README.org
# Go to that file run "M-x org-babel-tangle"

set -g mouse on

# Set new panes to open in current directory
bind C-c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind c new-session -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind s split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind v split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
#+end_src
** Tips
*** Start from a named session
`tmux new -s <session-name>`
*** Or rename from a new one
`C-a C-c` to create  new one
`C-a $` to rename it
*** Use shortcut to start session
`tmux a -t work`
`tmux attach -t work`
