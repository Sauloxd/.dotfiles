* TMUX
Configuring tmux is too hard, and I can't deal with another config.
Just use https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux and be happy
** Local Overrides
#+begin_src bash :tangle "tmux.conf.local"
#!/bin/bash
# This code is generated by README.org
# Go to that file run "M-x org-babel-tangle"

set -g mouse on

# Set new panes to open in current directory
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind v split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind V split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# disable "release mouse drag to copy and exit copy-mode", ref: https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/140
unbind-key -T copy-mode-vi MouseDragEnd1Pane

# since MouseDragEnd1Pane neither exit copy-mode nor clear selection now,
# let single click do selection clearing for us.
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi MouseDown1Pane select-pane\; send-keys -X clear-selection

# this line changes the default binding of MouseDrag1Pane, the only difference
# is that we use `copy-mode -eM` instead of `copy-mode -M`, so that WheelDownPane
# can trigger copy-mode to exit when copy-mode is entered by MouseDrag1Pane
bind -n MouseDrag1Pane if -Ft= '#{mouse_any_flag}' 'if -Ft= \"#{pane_in_mode}\" \"copy-mode -eM\" \"send-keys -M\"' 'copy-mode -eM'

set-option -g history-limit 100000

** Tips
*** Start from a named session
`tmux new -s <session-name>`
*** Or rename from a new one
`C-a C-c` to create  new one
`C-a $` to rename it
*** Use shortcut to start session
`tmux a -t work`
`tmux attach -t work`
